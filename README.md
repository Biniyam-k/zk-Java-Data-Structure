# Data Structure Introduction

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow efficient organization, storage, and retrieval of data. They provide a way to represent data and the relationships between data in a way that can be easily manipulated by algorithms. Some common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and hash tables.

Choosing the right data structure for a given problem is an important part of algorithm design, as it can greatly impact the efficiency of the solution. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures is essential for writing efficient and effective algorithms.
